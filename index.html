#### I am transparent. I am helpful. I experiment. I decide.

-   Only you have power over you &mdash; The mission is your boss.

-   Leadership is not tellership. It just means going first.

-   You can try anything, as long as you follow the advice process. The people you consult with don&rsquo;t have
    to agree with the decision, but you must talk to them.

    1.   Consult with someone who knows more about the subject than you.

    2.   Consult with those whom the decision will affect.

-   Anyone in the organization can come up with a great idea.

    -   Anyone in the organization can make any decision, by following the advice process.

    -   Everyone is equally valuable to the organization.

-   Experimentation is our greatest innovation.

    1.  If a significant percent of experiments don&rsquo;t fail, you&rsquo;re not taking enough risks.

    1.  Celebrate and analyze failures. We learn the most from them.

    1.  It&rsquo;s not consensus. We discover what works.

    1.  Experiment as much as you can.

    1.  But don&rsquo;t kill the organization.

-   Help, don&rsquo;t compete.

-   Act in the best interests of the community, the customer, the organization, your colleagues, and yourself.

-	**Evolutionary Purpose**: Where does the organization want to go?
	What experiments and decisions can you make to help get it there?

-   Transparency means everything that&rsquo;s legal. Each person, knowing as much as
    possible, contributes better ideas and better decisions.

-   There are many dimensions to growth. If you, and the organization, are not
    growing along at least one of these dimensions, we need to rethink.

-   If you don&rsquo;t have enough projects, keep looking, create one, or reinvent
    yourself (inside or outside of the organization).

-   Culture check: What are our goals? Are our incentives aligned with our
    goals?

-   Who are you serving? How do you discover what they need?

-   We resolve issues using conflict resolution practices.
    Non-violent communication tools enable us to speak to each other directly.

-   Personal consistency:

    1.  What we say and what we do are consistent.

    2.  No trickery or lying is tolerated.

    3.  No gossip. We respect everyone: coworkers, customers, vendors, community, everyone.

-   Money is a convenient mechanism for communicating favors, but money does not control us.
    Money is not power.

-	**Wholeness**: It's great that part of you helps the organization make money. But the organization prospers
	from *all* of you, not just the money-making part.

-   We succeed together, and we fail together.
